we will try neon led light style ,may be 2d or 3d , find them on google image
//basically just like 733N4g3 3Ng1N33R 0P1 ,we can take references from their "manual b00k" 
main features are piano, drumpads
will make differ from ori prod,  eg: UI, touchscreen so not much button needed
additional features, eg: can insert wallpaper, download sound from url link(youtube), trim sound
waymore cool and better than F1ip sampl3r

maybe a simple ledboard(like samsung led cover) for drawing gif animate while playing tracks
